# Description
This app was created for a developer who writes about technology so they can publish articles, blog posts, thoughts and opinions to a CMS-style blog site.

# Installation
A user will need to download and install node.js, npm Sequelize, npm dotenv, npm mysql2 and npm express.  The user will need to log into mysql and SOURCE the provided schema.sql file to create the database.  The user will also need to update the .env file with their mysql password.  Finally, the user will need run a 'npm start' at the command prompt. The user may also wish to upload it to a site like Heroku so it does not have to run locally.

# Usage
The applicatin is deployed on Heroku at the following link:

# Bugs
Currently the app is not running to all of it's routes correctly.  I under estimated how much time I needed to complete this rather lengthy project and I am currently coding and pushing more routes to the repo as I finish them and test them. I am hoping to have them completely before this is graded. I understand I will receive a lower grade if this is graded before I have them uploaded. However, I am trying to complete this 100% and will resubmit when complete and remove this text from my README.
